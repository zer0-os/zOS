# zOS

#### Flexible application platform for interacting with the Zer0 ecosystem

## Getting Started

1. clone the repo
1. run `npm install`
1. copy .env.example to .env and change/add the necessary values
1. run `npm start` to run the app or
1. `npm run test` to run the tests

## Ways to Participate

### Create an app

The [zOS Feed app](https://github.com/zer0-os/zOS-feed) is the first core app, and provides a template to follow. Get in touch with the zOS core team to discuss having your app integrated.

1. fork the zOS repo, as new apps still require some changes to the platform at this stage.
1. follow the getting started steps above and make sure you have a running zOS instance.
1. add a repo for your new app. you can copy the feed app to get the basics, or just start from scratch.
1. an app is just a component that conforms to the interface required by the platform. once you have the basics of your app in place, you can add it to the platform to make sure it loads correctly:
   1. add your package, and import in [src/app-sandbox/index.tsx](src/app-sandbox/index.tsx)
   1. add a conditional to the `renderSelectedApp` method that returns your component. if your app is covered by the default apps set, then use the corresponding member of the Apps enum.
   1. add your app to the allApps array in [src/lib/apps/index.ts](src/lib/apps/index.ts)
   1. make sure your app shows up in the menu, and that you can access it when the menu item is clicked.
   1. once you have a stable version of your app, you can create a PR to the core zOS repo with the platform changes, and the version of your app you would like released.

### Contribute to the Platform

There is always work to be done on the core platform, so if you've noticed a bug or want to get involved at a deeper level, feel free to open a PR, or get in touch with the core team. Be sure to check out the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [style guide](STYLE_GUIDE.md) before opening a PR.
