# Contributing to Zero

- PR required for all changes. PRs will be reviewed and merged by the core team.
- All PRs must come with appropriate tests.
- Commits should be squashed to appropriately useful commits (Eg. No “WIP” commits)
- CI must be passing or it won’t be reviewed

Other Considerations:

- Our team is small. Please ensure any code submitted in a PR is 'production ready'.
- If you're unsure what that means, consider reaching out to the core team, or submitting an 'in progress' PR to get feedback as early as possible.
- Try to keep changes small and focused.
- Review the [Zero style guide](STYLE_GUIDE.md) if this is your first time contributing to see any guidance or decisions that have been made to help ensure consistency across the project.
