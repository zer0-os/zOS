/**
 * NOTE: this module provides some isolation around web3-react while
 * allowing us to take advantage of the functionality in the
 * short-term. the project itself is a mess, and totally untested
 * but i *think* it should be safe enough to use short-term, as
 * some other popular-ish projects are using it. all we need from it is
 * the basic state management, so we should be able to keep it isolated
 * here until we have the time to replace it.
