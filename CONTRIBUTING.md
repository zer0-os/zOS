# Contributing to zOS

* PR required for all changes. PRs will be reviewed and merged by the core team.
* All PRs must come with appropriate tests.
* Commits should be squashed to appropriately useful commits (Eg. No “WIP” commits)
* CI must be passing or it won’t be reviewed

Other Considerations:
* Our team is small. Please ensure any code submitted in a PR is 'production ready'.
* If you're unsure what that means, consider reaching out to the core team, or submitting an 'in progress' PR to get feedback as early as possible.
* Try to keep changes small and focused.
